# My-Data-Science

Have created a repo to upload my practice works especially in Pandas. Have taken practice sheets from 'guipsamora' (special thanks to guipsamora) these are very very helpful practice files to have better understanding.

In the process of solving first exercise if find some interesting and userful library called 'Pyforest' would like to share basics of the same.

##### Lazy import in Python : Pyforest

Pyforest - lazy import of all popular Python Data Science libraries.
Stop writing the same imports over and over again.

`!pip install pyforest`

a simple one line code will solve your headache of importing separate line of
codes each library required for your project. Only when you are using inbuilt functions
that particular library will be installed automatically.

We can check what are all the libraries imported in our library by using below code

`active_imports()`

This line of code will give the list of libraries installed in your project.
